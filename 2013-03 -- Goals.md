## Goals

 * Average 4 runs per week
 * Average 21km per week
 * Avoid hilly terrain, seek flat surfaces
 * Control breathing
 * Find a device that will help me track heart rate throughout the day (not just while running)

## Runs

#### Day 1

**Distance** 10.2km  
**Breathing** Excellent  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** None  
**Muscular fatigue** None  
**Location** Providence

Ran twice for a total of 10.2km, felt extremely well, only stopped to tie my shoes.
Hilly terrain, up and down, felt very very well, no pain, thirst or fatigue, only
heavy breathing when going up steep hills.

#### Day 3

**Distance** 21.1km  
**Breathing** Good  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** Manageable  
**Muscular fatigue** Manageable  
**Location** San Francisco

Initially sat out to go for a ~15km mile, but ended up running more. Running through San Francisco,
I found a lot of hills, some of them really steep, I was able to run through them but with an obvious
effect on breathing.

Pain came in mostly on my knees in the final part of the run and after the run.

I had my first drop of water around km 15, wasn't too bad before that, but I ended up drinking too
much at that point and that affected the end of my run.
