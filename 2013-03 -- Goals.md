## Goals

 * Average 4 runs per week
 * Average 21km per week
 * Avoid hilly terrain, seek flat surfaces
 * Control breathing
 * Find a device that will help me track heart rate throughout the day (not just while running)

## Runs

#### Day 1

**Distance** 10.2km  
**Breathing** Excellent  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** None  
**Muscular fatigue** None  

Ran twice for a total of 10.2km, felt extremely well, only stopped to tie my shoes.
Hilly terrain, up and down, felt very very well, no pain, thirst or fatigue, only
heavy breathing when going up steep hills.
