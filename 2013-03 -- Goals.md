## Goals

 * Average 4 runs per week
 * Average 21km per week
 * Avoid hilly terrain, seek flat surfaces
 * Control breathing
 * Find a device that will help me track heart rate throughout the day (not just while running)

## Runs

#### Day 1

**Distance** 10.2km  
**Breathing** Excellent  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** None  
**Muscular fatigue** None  
**Location** Providence

Ran twice for a total of 10.2km, felt extremely well, only stopped to tie my shoes.
Hilly terrain, up and down, felt very very well, no pain, thirst or fatigue, only
heavy breathing when going up steep hills.

#### Day 3

**Distance** 21.1km  
**Breathing** Good  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** Manageable  
**Muscular fatigue** Manageable  
**Location** San Francisco

Initially sat out to go for a ~15km mile, but ended up running more. Running through San Francisco,
I found a lot of hills, some of them really steep, I was able to run through them but with an obvious
effect on breathing.

Pain came in mostly on my knees in the final part of the run and after the run.

I had my first drop of water around km 15, wasn't too bad before that, but I ended up drinking too
much at that point and that affected the end of my run.


#### Day 6

**Distance** 7.31km  
**Breathing** Good  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** None  
**Muscular fatigue** None  
**Location** Providence

Was a very cold day, I kept most of the terrain flat, with just a small number of up and downhills,
not very steep, and focusing on breathing I was able to control the hyperventilation.

The weather was very cold, and it rained for a while.

#### Day 7

**Distance** 5k  
**Breathing** Good  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** None  
**Muscular fatigue** None  
**Location** Treadmill

Since there was a snowstorm I ran inside, in a treadmill, I felt mentally exhausted immediately and
didn't stop thinking that I was running at any point.

#### Day 9

**Distance** 9k  
**Breathing** A little bit hyperventilated  
**Pain** None  
**Thirst** None  
**Muscular fatigue** Only on uphill  
**Location** Providence

I ran towards the gym and back, doing quite a bit of uphill and downhill running.

#### Day 13

**Distance** 10.6k  
**Breathing** A little bit hyperventilated  
**Pain** A small annoyance on the right knee  
**Thirst** Significant  
**Muscular fatigue** Not relevant  
**Location** Treadmill

I ended up running on the treadmill instead of outside, boredom gets the best of me
when running on a treadmill, and I start increasing the pace to 4m km and get tired
and hyperventilated after a while. Maintaining a steady pace on treadmill becomes
quite hard, and there are so many distractions, like where within the space I'm running,
the TV, the static surroundings, the tracking device, etc. If I'm going to continue using
the treadmill I need to find a way to be able to do without getting distracted.
