# Races I want to run

## Boston Marathon

Spring marathon through Boston, what could be better than that?!

Requires qualifying by posting time in a previous race.

## New York Marathon

The legend among marathons. A must for any runner. Its a late autumn run, so
weather can be a bigger problem.

## Berlin Marathon

Running through the legendary city of the big wall, running at the pace of The
Wall really does sound like an amazing dream.
